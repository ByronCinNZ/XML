XML schema, transforms, schematron rules, and examples for ISO TC211 Metadata Standards

This repository contains draft XML schema and related documents for the ISO TC211 metadata (ISO 19115-1) 
and data quality (ISO 19157). These are not final schemas for these standards but may be suitable for 
initial testing and familiarization. They are provided here to support those kinds of use cases 
without any expectation for persistence.
